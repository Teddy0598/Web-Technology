        <h2>Mary Help of Christians Cathedral, Shillong</h2>
      <p>The Cathedral of Mary Help of Christians is a Cathedral in Shillong, Meghalaya. It is the cathedral church of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Shillong and serves as the seat of the Metropolitan Archbishop of Shillong. It covers the districts of East Khasi Hills and Ri-Bhoi. The Cathedral is the principal place of worship of the over 300,000 strong Catholics of the Shillong Archdiocese which covers RI Bhoi and East Khasi Hills district of Meghalaya. In all, there are 33 church district's or "Parishes" in the Shillong Archdiocese. The Cathedral Church was built over 50 years ago. This place of worship stands on the very site of the first Church built by the German fathers. The earlier 1913 building – the Church of the Divine Saviour – was a wooden structure. It was destroyed by the Good Friday fire of April 10, 1936. Built by the first Catholic missionaries to arrive at these hills, the Salvatorian Fathers from Germany, it was the first Catholic cathedral church in what was then the Apostolic Prefecture of Assam.</p>
