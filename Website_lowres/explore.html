      <h1>EXPLORE SHILLONG</h1>
      <h2>Whats Unique about Shillong, Meghalaya ?</h2>
      <p>Summertime is when the entire subcontinent blisters and bakes under a torrid sun. The vacations are the best time to sneak off to cooler climes, wherever possible. Luckily for us, the Indian landscape is as varying as it is beautiful. So while you can forget the scorching deserts and beaches in these hot months, the gift of the Himalayas is truly worth basking in. The Seven Sister states are the contiguous states of Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Meghalaya, Manipur, Mizoram, Nagaland and Tripura in North Eastern India and are relatively untouched, unexplored and isolated.<br><br>Of these, Meghalaya, located in undulating pine covered hills, has a milder climate than tropical India. Shillong is its beautiful capital, home to several waterfalls, parks, rolling hills and quaint land forms, and also known as the ’Scotland of the East’. Shillong receives heavy rainfalls during monsoon and the rainy season usually lasts longer than in the rest of India. Although tourists avoid the rainy season, it is generally the time when the city is clean and
      waterfalls are in full strength and thus a delight to behold.</p>

        <h2>Easy to reach</h2>
        <img src="images/easy.jpg">
            <p>By Air: Unlike most other hill stations, Shillong can be reached in a hop. The Shillong Airport is in Umroi, about 40 km from Shillong, also known as Barapani Air Force Base or Umroi Airport. It is a small airport with flights via Alliance Air (operated by Indian Airlines) to and from Kolkata on certain days of the week. A State Tourism bus operates from the Airport to the Shillong market. Cabs are also available.

            However, flights to Umroi are unpredictable and generally cancelled at the last minute due to bad weather. Guwahati Airport, which is 3 to 3.5 hours from Shillong, is a more preferred option. From the Guwahati airport, cabs and buses take you to the city comfortably. The roads are wide and the drive isn't too steep. There are many refreshment points along the way.

            By Rail: Meghalaya does not have rail lines of its own. The nearest railway station is Guwahati, 105 km from Shillong and very well connected with all the major cities of India.</p>

        <h2>Meet One Of Our Rarest And Friendliest Tribes</h2>
        <img src="images/culture.jpg">
         <p>
       The Shillong population mostly belongs to the Khasi tribe, who are predominantly Christian. There are also a significant number of Assamese, Bengali and Nepali minorities. An interesting aspect of the Khasis are that they are a matrilineal society. Therefore the mother's surname is passed on to the children and the youngest daughter inherits the ancestral property.

            Can you imagine the celebration the birth of a daughter entails? And the special pampering the youngest daughter receives?
